# Total-TDM-Tool

The Total TDM Tool, affectionately known as the ttt, is a Esri Web AppBuilder (WAB) appp that was envisioned to visualize model results from the TDM. The user uploades a road segment summary shapfile and PHP code generates the json for use in the app. Different modules were envisioned but never fully implemented.

Development was discontinued and a next generation visualization tool, the vizTool, using arcgis javascript api rather than Web AppBuilder was ultimately implemented.
